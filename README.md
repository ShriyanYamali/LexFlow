# Setup and Installation Guide

### Differences Between `lexflow-weighted.py` and `lexflow-styled.py.ipynb`
1. **File Format and Purpose:**
lexflow-styled.py.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook that supports interactive code execution, user input, and dynamic visualization.
lexflow-weighted.py is a Python script for linear execution, without direct support for interactive inputs or step-by-step execution.
2. **User Interaction:**
lexflow-styled.py.ipynb uses ipywidgets for interactive input, enabling a more dynamic user experience.
lexflow-weighted.py relies on console-based input (input()), offering less dynamic interaction.
3. **Visualization and Styling:**
lexflow-styled.py.ipynb uses matplotlib with custom settings for enhanced visual quality.
lexflow-weighted.py may use matplotlib but focuses on basic, straightforward outputs.
4. **Handling of Weights and Importance of Legal Principles:**
lexflow-styled.py.ipynb does not handle the relative weights of legal principles.
lexflow-weighted.py allows input of weights and importance, influencing the program's computations.
5. **Code Structure and Modularity:**
lexflow-styled.py.ipynb is modular, with code organized into cells for iterative development.
lexflow-weighted.py is a single script with linear execution, less suited for iterative development.
6. **Use of Libraries:**
lexflow-styled.py.ipynb uses libraries like ipywidgets for interactivity and enhanced display options.
lexflow-weighted.py uses standard libraries (matplotlib, numpy) for core functionality.
7. **Intended Use Case:**
lexflow-styled.py.ipynb is ideal for educational purposes, with interactive features and explanations.
lexflow-weighted.py is designed for practical applications with straightforward, quick computations.


## Downloading and Installing Python
### This is necessary for both lexflow-weighted.py and lexflow-styled.py.ipynb.
1. **Visit the Python website:** Go to the official Python website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Download Python:** Click on the "Downloads" tab and choose the latest version for Windows. An installer file will download.
3. **Run the Installer:** Open the downloaded installer file.
4. **Customize Installation:** Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH." This is important for running Python from the command line.
